        Steps
    </h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Combine 1/2 cup water, sugar, and yeast in a small bowl, stirring with a whisk. Let stand 5 minutes or until
            yeast mixture is bubbly.</li>
        <li>Weigh or lightly spoon flours, potato starch, and flaxseed meal into dry measuring cups; level with a knife.
            Combine flours, potato starch, flaxseed meal, xanthan gum, and salt in a large bowl; beat with a mixer at
            medium speed until blended. Add yeast mixture, 1 tablespoon oil, egg whites, and egg; beat at low speed 1
            minute or until combined. Increase speed to medium; beat 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Coat a baking sheet with 1 teaspoon oil. Scrape dough onto pan. Lightly coat hands with oil. Press dough
            into a 14-inch circle, coating hands with oil as needed to prevent dough from sticking. Coat top of dough
            with any remaining oil. Cover with plastic wrap, and let rise in a warm place (85°), free from drafts, for
            30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400°.</li>
        <li>Remove plastic wrap, and bake crust at 400° for 17 minutes or until bottom lightly browns. Cool completely.
            Increase oven temperature to 425°.</li>
        <li>Spread marinara over crust, leaving a 1/2-inch border; top with mozzarella cheese, pepperoni, and Parmesan
            cheese. Bake at 425° for 16 minutes or until crust is golden and cheese melts.</li>
    </ol>
